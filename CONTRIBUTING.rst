Code of Conduct
---------------

Like the technical community as a whole, the pwhash team and community is made
up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world,
working on every aspect of the missing - including mentorship, teaching and
connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to when they're participating within this community and
project. These rules apply equally to contributors and those seeking help.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things you can't do. Rather, take it in the
spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us
and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all communication.

* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
* Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
  a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people
  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the
  pwhash community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
  well as with people outside the pwhash community.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
  other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to
  others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally.
  Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
  appropriate for the community.

When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and pwhash is no exception. It is important
that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
that we're different. The strength of pwhash comes from its varied community,
people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
perspective on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that is is human to
err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help
resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
