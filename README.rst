pwhash
======

pwhash is a library in an early stage of development, aiming to provide secure
and easy to use password hashing, relying on OpenSSL_ and CommonCrypto_
implementations of password hashing algorithms. Eventually users should be able
to use pwhash without having to be familiar with cryptography and state of the
art password hashing algorithms, without sacrificing security.
