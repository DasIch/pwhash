    Determines how many rounds are needed for hashing to take approximately

    :param password_length:
        Should be the lowest allowed password length. Note that longer
        passwords take more time, take this into account when specifying the
        allowed range.
    :param salt_length: The length of the used salt in bytes.
    :param hash_length: The length of the used hash in bytes.
    :param method: The method to be used.
    :param duration:
        The amount of time that is acceptable for password hashing in seconds.
        You probably want this to be between 0.1 to 0.5 seconds.

    This works by benchmarking :func:`pwhash.algorithms.pbkdf2`, so this is
    something you want to perform only once for every machine when it's idle,
    with every update of pwhash, OpenSSL or CommonCrypto and with every method
    change and obviously parameter change. If you are re-determining the number
    of rounds be careful to check that the result is not lower than the number
    of rounds you have been using so far, unless that is to be expected due to
    downgrades.
